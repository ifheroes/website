                            <li>1.1 First you create an inquiry in our support or contact your responsible person via Discord / Teamspeak.</li>
                            <li>1.2 The second step is to speak with us about your idea or project you planned on your custom server</li>
                            <li>1.3 If we think your idea incredible enough you can set up your server and get started</li>
                            <li>1.4 After your setup, you can already start.</li>
                            <br>
                            <b>2. What should I consider when requesting a private server?</b><br>
                            In any case, you should give us an explanation of what exactly you are planning. It is helpful to provide as many details as possible to be able to perfectly adapt the server to you.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>3. Do I have all rights on this server?</b><br>
                            On a private server you have all rights (operator), you have special access to the console via a web interface.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>4. How long is the maximum term?</b><br>
                            The maximum term is either one month or as long as agreed with our service runner and broadcaster team.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>5. Can the server simply be closed?</b><br>
                            Yes, as soon as we notice that the server is no longer used and there is no longer any interest in the near future.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>6. Do I lose access to my server as soon as I lose the broadcaster rank?</b><br>
                            Yes, unless otherwise agreed. If this is not the case, please contact our support.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>7. I am planning a project for a few days, can I also have a private server for a short time?</b><br>
                            It is possible, however, must first be approved by the administration
                            <br><br>
                            <b>8. How long does it take before I receive a confirmation and my server?</b><br>
                            We usually have an answer after a few hours, but usually we need about 72 hours.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>9. What happens if my server is no longer accessible during the runtime?</b><br>
                            Should technical problems arise, we will of course extend the term. If there is a small single failure, this will not be considered.

                            <b>10. I have lost my login details. What to do?</b><br>
